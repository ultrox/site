# Default arguments powered by obj destructuring

Recently I was looking thrue the code of [dom-testing-libary] and noticed unusual sintax, I understood what it dose but I didn't know what was it.
I certainly knew about default arguments, but this was very usiful. 

```
// What exactly happens here?
function createElement ({
  content = 'Very default',
  classNames = ['module-text', 'special']
} = {}) {
  // function body
}
```

Mostly I was confused by the empty obj at the end. It turns out it's a trick to use config obj optionaly.

Instantly this become my favorite function.
